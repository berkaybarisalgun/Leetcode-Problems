# LeetCode Solutions

This repository tracks my progress through the roadmap of LeetCode challenges as listed on [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Below is a list of problems I have solved, each linked to the most efficient solution in this repository. For other approaches, please check the `solutions` directory.

## Solved Problems

### Arrays & Hashing
- [x] [Problem 1: Contains Duplicate](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Contains_Duplicate_217/Solution3.java) - Return true if any value in the integer array nums appears at least twice, otherwise return false. For the problem description, see [Contains Duplicate on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/).

- [x] [Problem 2: Valid Anagram](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Valid_Anagram_242/Solution2.java) - Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
