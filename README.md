# LeetCode Solutions

This repository tracks my progress through the roadmap of LeetCode challenges as listed on [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Below is a list of problems I have solved, each linked to the most efficient solution in this repository. For other approaches, please check the `solutions` directory.

## Solved Problems

### Arrays & Hashing
- [x] [Problem 1: Contains Duplicate](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Contains_Duplicate_217/Solution3.java) - Return true if any value in the integer array nums appears at least twice, otherwise return false. For the problem description, see [Contains Duplicate on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/).

- [x] [Problem 2: Valid Anagram](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Valid_Anagram_242/Solution2.java) - Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. For the problem description, see [Valid Anagram on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/).

- [x] [Problem 3: Two Sum](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Two_Sum_1/Solution2.java) - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. For the problem description, see [Two Sum on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/).

- [X] [Problem 4: Group Anagrams](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Group_Anagrams_49/Solution.java) - Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. For the problem description, see [Group Anagrams LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/).

- [X] [Problem 5: Top K Frequent Elements](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Top_K_Frequent_Elements/Solution.java) - Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order. For the problem description, see [Top K Frequent Elements LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements).

- [ ] [Problem 6: String Encode and Decode](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/) - Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings. For the problem description, see [String Encode and Decode](https://neetcode.io/problems/string-encode-and-decode).

- [ ] [Problem 7: Product of Array Except Self](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/) - Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. For the problem description, see [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/).
