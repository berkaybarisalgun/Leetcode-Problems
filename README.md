# LeetCode Solutions

This repository tracks my progress through the roadmap of LeetCode challenges as listed on [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Below is a list of problems I have solved, each linked to the most efficient solution in this repository. For other approaches, please check the `solutions` directory.

## Solved Problems

### Arrays & Hashing
- [x] [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) - Return true if any value in the integer array nums appears at least twice, otherwise return false. For the solution, see [Contains Duplicate on GitHub](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Contains_Duplicate_217/Solution3.java).

- [x] [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/) - Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. For the solution, see [Valid Anagram on GitHub](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Valid_Anagram_242/Solution2.java).

- [x] [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/) - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. For the solution, see [Two Sum on GitHub](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Two_Sum_1/Solution2.java).

- [x] [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) - Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. For the solution, see [Group Anagrams on GitHub](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Group_Anagrams_49/Solution.java).

- [x] [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements) - Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order. For the solution, see [Top K Frequent Elements on GitHub](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/Leetcode-Problems/blob/main/Leetcode/src/main/java/Top_K_Frequent_Elements/Solution.java).

- [ ] [String Encode and Decode](https://neetcode.io/problems/string-encode-and-decode) - Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings. For the solution, see [String Encode and Decode on GitHub](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/).

- [ ] [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/) - Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. For the solution, see [Product of Array Except Self on GitHub](https://github.com/berkaybarisalgun/).
